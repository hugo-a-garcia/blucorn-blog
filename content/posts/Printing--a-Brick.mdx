title: 3D Printing of a Lego Compatible Brick using an Iterative and Incremental Development Approach

## Introduction

As a software developer I value having an iterative and incremental development
approach for building software. A process which seeks to answer not only "what"
we are building but also "how" we are building it. An approach which has been developed for decades
and has many implementations. I naively hoped to find such a process for
additive manufacturing but haven't yet. What I did find were many text and video
tutorials on how to set up the printer, use the basic functions of a CAD
software to create a model, use the model for creating a file that can be
consumed by the printer and finally refine the print by various hardware and
software settings and upgrades. Which led me to a first general approach to
additive manufacturing:

    1 Make the printer work.
    2 (Re)Make a 3D model.
    3 Print the model.
    4 If the manufactured part is not good then goto 1
    5 Model successfully manufactured.

It took time to figure out each of the previously mentioned steps but the
question still remained, "Is there a general
method for additive manufacturing that will help to produce a part which will
be assembled with other parts?". Could the above process be formalized into some
kind of reproducible iterative development process?

To answer the question I decided to explore the manufacturing process of a Lego
compatible brick. The challenge being to create a CAD model which could be used
for manufacturing a brick with low dimensional tolerance and allowances. Thus,
the model has to be parameterized in order to make refinements between
iterations to conform with the inherent mechanical and manufacturing limitations
of using an FFF printer.

## Previous Work

A very good article at prusaprinters.org illustrates the challenges of printing
Lego compatible parts. The article mentions the difficulty of finding good
models for printing and provides a set of STL models of bricks for printing. Yet, STL models in general
are difficult to modify and not usable as a starting point in this project.  Also, it is not clear if the offered models can be
used in different printers since they were created
using only one specific model of Prusa brand printer. Yet, the article is very
informative and should be kept in mind.

For this project we need to start with a CAD model and not an STL. It is not easy to find proper CAD models of bricks for printing. Although is easy
to find CAD models from public sources such as GrabCAD. The available models are mostly meant to
be for use within a CAD and not for 3D printing bricks. Thus we must construct
our own model in a CAD. Various video tutorials
on YouTube explain how to design a Lego brick using various CAD software. Yet, the
major hinderance of CAD models found in public sources is the lack of detail
and/or agreement on the dimensions of a Lego brick.
